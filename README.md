Brick Pixel Editor

This painting tool is designed to be useful for creating pixel brick patterns
for Brick Brick Gear Pixel front plates.  If you don't know what those are,
check out their rad hats at https://www.brickbrickgear.com

The template here has the exact same dimensions--in terms of brick units--as the
Brick Brick Pixel plates (36 x 16).  Due to the miniscule size of the pixel
bricks, creating patterns directly on the plates with actual bricks can be quite
tedious.  I created this because I wanted to rapidly prototype and tweak designs
before getting down to the nitty gritty of placing pixel bricks.

The color palette contains only the colors of pixel bricks sold by Brick Brick
Gear, so you know you can create IRL whatever designs you make here.
The counter on each color keeps track of how many bricks of that color you've
laid down.  That way, you'll always know if you have enough to make the
design or if it's time to order more pixels bricks.

I am working on making this thing mobile friendly, so you can create with your
favorite devices on the go.  For now, Brick Pixel Editor is best experienced on
a computer.  Click or click-and-drag to lay down some bricks!

If you find this tool useful, I would love to hear from you and get any
feedback you'd be willing to share.
